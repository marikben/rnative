# rnative
This is a school project for Haaga-Helia's mobile app development course. Here I am briefly listing the technologies used:
-React Native (Android Build)
-Node JS
-Expo: AppLoading, Fonts, ImagePicker,
-React Native: (that has not been covered in other course assignments): Platform, TouchableWithoutFeedback, Calendar, withNavigation, DrawerActions, TouchableOpacity,
createAppContainer, createSwitchNavigator, createDrawerNavigator, Dimensions, ActivityIndicator, DropDownPicker, Modal, Pressable, ActivityIndicator. Plus  I used 
them to create the carousel view and to combine drawer navigator with header, to mention some "combination". One of the biggest things I learned was how to combine
these technologies.
-Custom fonts and how to sync them with your app (I used fonts from FontSpace).
-I also learned how to use classes and other functions that have state, as we have only used stateless functions in the course.
-Firebase: user registration, delete and login; store, delete and add items to different tables for the user; store, add and delete calendar data plus creating storage for all that, for the user.
-I used https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/ for the makeup data that i fetched in json format
